# Storage-Optimization
 This my Final Year Project.

 # Description
This project focuses on developing strategies to optimize the placement of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) onto pallets in fulfillment centers to maximize space utilization and minimize wastage. The challenge arises from the diversity of products, each with different shapes, sizes, and fragility. The solution aims to efficiently arrange these SKUs while considering constraints such as product compatibility, mixed placement requirements, and pallet stability.

# Key Features

**Simulation Framework:** A configurable framework to simulate various SKU placement strategies under different conditions, such as SKU quantity, shape, size, and arrival patterns.
**SKU Arrival Generator:** A generator that creates various arrival patterns using real-world datasets or statistical distributions to simulate different operational scenarios.
**Placement Algorithms**: Customizable algorithms that determine the most efficient way to place SKUs on pallets while adhering to operational constraints.
**Real-Time Visualization**: A 3D Visualization of SKU placement, allowing users to monitor and analyze the placement process as it happens.

# Technologies Used:

**Programming Languages:**
Python
**Libraries:**
NumPy, Matplotlib
**Frameworks:**
Visual Studio Code
